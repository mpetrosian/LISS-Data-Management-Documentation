Welcome to the LISS Data Management project's documentation!
============================================================

Documentation on the `liss-data` repository. This repository cleans the datasets of the
LISS (Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social sciences) panel. It is written in
Python.


About LISS Panel
----------------

The `LISS panel <https://www.lissdata.nl/>`_ is an internet-based household panel
administered by CentERdata (Tilburg University, The Netherlands). The sample is drawn
from the Dutch population via random sampling. Every month, participants answer
questionnaires that are exclusively reserved for research purposes. Respondents are
financially compensated for all questions they answer.

Motivation
---------- 

Data cleaning is an important component of empirical research projects. The goal of
this repository is to share the effort associated with the most basic parts of data
cleaning.

The basic idea is that all fundamental data cleaning that is helpful in (almost) all
projects using this data set should be done within the liss-data repo. Examples are the
renaming of variables, renaming of values (e.g. "I don't know -> np.nan"), or the
calculation of simple variables that are often used (e.g. `has_risky_financial_assets =
risky_financial_assets > 0`).

Conversely, specific data management that is mostly relevant for your project, in
particular the merging of data sets and selecting of specific observations, should be
done outside of this repo in your own project folder.
