Welcome to the LISS Panel Data Management project's documentation!
==================================================================

The `<LISS panen https://www.lissdata.nl/>`_ is an internet-based household panel administered by CentERdata (Tilburg University, The Netherlands). The sample is drawn from the Dutch population via random sampling. Every month, participants answer questionnaires that are exclusively reserved for research purposes. Respondents are financially compensated for all questions they answer.
